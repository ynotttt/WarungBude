# WarungBude
Many food stalls, also called Warteg are growing around us, spread like hectic because of basic needs that must be met despite material difficulties or time limitations. Warteg Bude is one of them. At every meal break, it becomes crowded by starving people who have to queue for a long time and chuckled out during food taking even when they want to eat it too. Bude is puzzled to serve every customer that results in the open risk of bad customer intentions, yet at the same time, she wants to maximize profits while preparing for the next dish stock. Hence, Bude was conceived to implement a Warteg management application. The objective of this application is the seller simply requires to fill in the customer's identification and the order based on dish options that have been prepared beforehand. All the data is stored automatically for later use by the seller. Please help Bude make this application so everyone can eat peacefully!
